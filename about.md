I'm a software developer from Caracas, Venezuela. I'm passionate about
using best practices and solving interesting problems.

I'm writing this blog because I want to share my knowledge and help people in this
fascinating world of computer programming. I love functional programming, so this blog 
will have a lot of content about programming languages as Clojure, Erlang, Elixir, Scala, etc. 
I'm planning to add some content about other topics related with general software development 
and best practices too, I think my experience will be my main resource to generate content 
for this blog.

I'm still learning everyday, so I really would appreciate some feedback about my posts.

### More about me

When I'm not coding or blogging I enjoy casual reading, mostly fiction, adventure
and tech books. I'm open to any recommendation to expand my book collection too.

##### Favorite books

* The Foundation(Trilogy) - *Isaac Asimov*
* Living Clojure - *Carin Meier*
* Inferno - *Dan Brown*
